# ComputerVision_Teak_Assignement2
In this assignment, you will write code to detect discriminating features in an image and find the best matching features in other images. Because features should be reasonably invariant to translation, rotation (plus illumination and scale if you do the extra credit), you'll use a feature descriptor discussed during lecture and you'll evaluate its performance on a suite of benchmark images. As part of the extra credit you'll have the option of creating your own feature descriptors. In the Project, you will apply your features to automatically stitch images into a panorama.
